## Problem Statement
This dashboard helps the online ecommerce store to understand their customers better. It helps the them know if their customers are satisfied with their products and sales. Through look at the graphs, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know which product made highest sales where and when, thus since by using this dashboard they can indentify the stock required at different states.

### Steps followed 

 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
 2 : Check all the coloumns and perform data cleaning if necessary.
 3 : Perform transform data to add/remove/merge column or for any other changes.
 4 : Close and apply the data to load the dataset.
 5 : Here i have used stacked column chart, stacked bar chart, donut chart, normal cards and slicers to represent the data visualisation. 
 6 : With the given charts we can identify the months and quaters where the highest sales were made as well as the profit and loss. Other areas can also be identified for eg. the customer name who made the highest purchase, highest sold item category, highest sales made in which state and which payment mode was used by most of the customers.
